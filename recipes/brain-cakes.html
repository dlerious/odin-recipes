        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These spongy brain cakes are equal parts spooky and delicious!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Cup Cakes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>125g Butter, Softened</li>
            <li>1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup Caster Sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Cups Self-Raising Flour, Sifted</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup Milk</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pink Icing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>250g Butter, Softened</li>
            <li>3 Cups Icing Sugar Mixture</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoon Milk</li>
            <li>Pink Gel Food Coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced. Line a 12-hole, 1/3 cup-capacity muffin pan with paper cases.</li>
            <li>Using an electric mixer, beat butter, vanilla and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating after each addition. Add flour and milk. Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/4 cup mixture into each paper case. Bake for 25 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the centre of 1 cake comes out clean. Stand cakes in pan for 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.</li>
            <li>Make Pink icing: Using an electric mixer, beat butter until pale and fluffy. Gradually add icing sugar mixture and milk, beating constantly until combined. Tint pale pink using pink food colouring.</li>
            <li>Spread cakes with icing to form a mound. Using a butter knife, mark a line through the icing, in the middle of each cake. Spoon remaining icing into a piping bag fitted with a 8mm round nozzle. Using the picture as a guide, pipe icing onto each cake to form brains.</li>
        </ol>
